After lectures on Object Orintated Programming (OOP) Enrique fields questions on Classes.

##Using Boris_Bikes

run this in your terminal

    git clone git@github.com:jamesascarter/boris_bikes2.git

Then cd into the boris_bikes2 folder and run irb (the interactive ruby terminal)

    2.0.0-p353 :001 > require_relative 'runner.rb'

 This line will load all the classes James and I wrote so you can play with them like this. Try to make a new bike like this.

    2.0.0-p353 :002 > bike = Bike.new
     => #<Bike:0x007fff43245c80 @broken=false>
